**To learn how to develop games, I:**
- Completed huge courses at Netology as "UE4 Game Developer" and "C++ Programmer"
- Participated in a game jam as a level designer
- Fully immersed myself in preparing project documentation and balancing gameplay
- Created a fully functional shooter game prototype in UE4 as a diploma project 
- Developed my own game using UE4 blueprints
- Self-studied SFML

**During my studies at Netology, I implemented projects in:**
